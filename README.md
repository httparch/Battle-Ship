# Battleship Game
This repository contains the implementation of a simple Battleship game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows players to guess the locations of hidden ships on a 7x7 grid and provides feedback on hits, misses, and sunk ships.

## Features
Interactive User Interface: Display messages, hits, and misses on the game board.
**Random Ship Placement: **

Ships are randomly placed on the board at the start of the game.
**Real-Time Feedback:**

Immediate feedback on hits, misses, and sunk ships.
**User Input Handling:**

Handle user guesses through button clicks and key presses.

# How to Play

Enter your guess in the input box (e.g., "A3") and click the "Fire" button or press Enter.
The game will display whether you hit or missed a ship.
Keep guessing until all ships are sunk.
The game will display the number of guesses it took to sink all the ships.
